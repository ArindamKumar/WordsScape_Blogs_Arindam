### A simple blogging website made using Node js, Express js and EJS. 

It displays all the posts on the home page, wherein you can create new posts, as well as edit or delete existing posts.

_In order to set this up on your local system, you must have node js installed on your computer **[preferably the latest LTS version, 22.13.0]**_

After pulling the repository on to your local computer, install the required node modules by running the `npm install` command.

After you are done, initialize the node packages by running `npm init -y`.

It will create a `package.json` file.

Install `nodemon` on your system, globally, by running `npm install -g nodemon`.

_It is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected._
_[Visit `https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon` for more information]_

Finally, set up the Server by running `nodemon Server.js`. The message of the Server running  on a port, _[3000]_ will be displayed on the console of your terminal.
Go to `localhost:_[portName]_` _[3000 in this case]_ on your browser, and there, you will be able to view the whole website.
